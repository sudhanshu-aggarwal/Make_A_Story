        <h1>The <span class="animal-1"></span> and The <span class="animal-2"></span></h1><br>
        <p>
            A <span class="animal-1"></span> was making fun of the <span class="animal-2"></span> one day for being so slow.
            <br><br>

            "Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked with a mocking laugh. <br><br>

            "<span class="radio"></span>", replied the <span class="animal-2"></span>, "but I get there <span class="speed"></span> than you think. I'll run you a race and prove it." <br><br>

            The <span class="animal-1"></span> was much <span class="adj-1"></span> at the idea of running a race with the <span class="animal-2"></span>, but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the <span class="animal-3"></span>, who had consented to act as judge, marked the distance yelled, "<span class="quote"></span>". <br><br>

            The <span class="animal-1"></span> was soon far out of sight, and to make the <span class="animal-2"></span> feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a <span class="animal-1"></span>, he went off the course to practice <span class="verb-1"></span> for <span class="num1"></span> hours until the <span class="animal-2"></span> should catch up. <br><br>

            The <span class="animal-2"></span> meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the place where the <span class="animal-1"></span> was <span class="verb-1"></span>. The <span class="animal-1"></span> was so caught up in <span class="verb-1"></span>; and when at last he did stop, the <span class="animal-2"></span> was near the goal. The <span class="animal-1"></span> now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake the <span class="animal-2"></span> in time.
